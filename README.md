# About (repo moved)

This repository has moved to https://github.com/opengeos/open-buildings. Please update your links, and I'll likely remove this in a month or two. Original description:

This repo is intended to be a set of useful scripts for working with Google's [Open Buildings](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/)
dataset, specifically to help translate it into [Cloud Native Geospatial](https://cloudnativegeo.org) formats. The outputs will live
at https://beta.source.coop/cholmes/google-open-buildings so most people can just make use of those directly. But these are intended to
show the process, and then they've expanded to be a way to benchmark performance. It's an odd mix right now, if I have time I'll try to
factor out an independent 'performance' CLI to compare processes without being specific to google open buildings and mixing in functionality
like splitting multipolygons.
